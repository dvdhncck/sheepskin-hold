.- become nullsafe

.- figure out what happens with different sized images

.- fix folder picking on pixel

-. info screen when there are no folders added

 if so, cancel it - although why wouldn't the previous cancel already have killed it?

-. fix the updating of "images found" to be somehow executed in the background, but to signal back when it is done
(might be a library function, probably has to use ports to signal

.- images effects - tinting, fading, etc


-------------

image scanning (on path add, remove) must happen fully backgrounded
- and update the "images found" label with some progress, or something like that
